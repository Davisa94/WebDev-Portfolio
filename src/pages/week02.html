                What did I do since the last meeting?
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                I contacted the ISP and had them set up the internet connection to allow me to host the site on my own hardware to give me more experience hosting and managing
                a site from top to bottom. This week I focuesd on the servers security and getting the DNS set up after the static IP was set up.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            What am I going to do next?
            What are my blockers?
