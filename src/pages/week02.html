                As I was reading through the assigned articles and books I was inspired by all the talk of javascript to finally move my index javascript to the main.js file. <br> This will allow me to easily re-use all of the functions I made and allow me to consilodate all code for general scripts into one location. This has really helped me to get re-aquainted with javascript after a brief lapse in using it.

                What did I do since the last meeting?

                I contacted the ISP and had them set up the internet connection to allow me to host the site on my own hardware to give me more experience hosting and managing
                a site from top to bottom. This week I focuesd on the servers security and getting the DNS set up after the static IP was set up. Next week I will work on revamping the entire sites style sheet.
            </li>

            <li class="header two">
                What am I going to do next?
            </li>
            <li class="text-body main list" style="list-style-type: none;">
                Next week I will work on revamping the entire sites style sheet. And make it consistent across the whole site.
            </li>
            <li class="header two">
                What are my blockers?
            </li>          
            <li class="text-body main list" style="list-style-type: none;">
                The main blockers for me are my dissabilites and the lack of cooperation from my ISp, but one of those two has been partially resolved.
