            <p>
                This weeks reading was focused on more javscript activities, I took this oppurtunity to try and teach my wife how to program in javascript, I failed, Next week I will try again and hope to have more success. It is unuiqe, when I first learned about javascript we were taught a more linear way of programming. The first language I learned OO programming in was C++ and because the principles are transferable all I had to re-learn was syntax and language specific quirks, the reading was a good refresher on these principles.

            <li class="header two">
                What did I do since the last meeting?
            </li>
            <li class="text-body main list" style="list-style-type: none;">
                I re-did the styling too stand out a bit more, its not final but hopefully will be soon. I centrelized all styling to fit into one stylesheet to ensure consistent styling.
            </li>

            <li class="header two">
                What am I going to do next?
            </li>
            <li class="text-body main list" style="list-style-type: none;">
                My next site-wide goal is to change the background of text areas to emulate a parchment effect or style. Then I want to start doing a series of javscript projects.
            </li>
            <li class="header two">
                What are my blockers?
            </li>          
            <li class="text-body main list" style="list-style-type: none;">
                The main blockers for me are my dissabilites and the monotony of re-learning things that I have largley already learned causing a lack of engagment with the activity at hand.
            </li>
        </ul>
