		<p>
        This week was mainly a review of things I had already learned. A lot of it was review and getting the rust of of my javascript after not using it for a few
        months. The site is currently being hosted on github because I spent like 6 hours searching for a vga cable for my old computer that I was going to set up as a web server
        by next week it should be up and functional, I have a cord on its way I Had to buy one. I cant believe that actually finding the hardware was the hardest part
        for this software course. The video was informative as I had not really thought about desinging for mobile but since it is the largest userbase for the internet
        it makes sense to do so.
